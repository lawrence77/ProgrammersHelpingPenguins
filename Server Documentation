ssh connection
First download the admin-key-pair-ohio.pem
ssh -i path-to-.pem-file ec2-user@ec2-18-216-185-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Password: root

Ip address of website
ec2-18-216-185-213.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Apache root directory is               (this is where we will place our code and .htaccess)

Setup database locally
after launching phpmyadmin locally go to 
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/server_privileges.php?username=root&hostname=localhost&dbname=&tablename=&routinename= 

Click on change password at the top, type in root root and press go in bottom right.

After go to 
C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin
open the file 
config.inc.php
change the line 
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = ''; => $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'root';

You might need to restart phpMyadmin
